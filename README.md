# Gemstore

## Description
A Gemstore built on Angular (from the Code School tutorial 'Shape Up with Angular') and integrated with Ruby on Rails. Currently populates from a products.JSON file, but eventually will be linked to the Rails persistent database. Read more about this process and my reflections on Angular at (http://marydickson.com/try-angular/).

See it at (https://railsy-gemstore.herokuapp.com/).
